This is a simple neural network based on Daniel Shiffman's Toy Neural Network implemented in JavaScript.
There is no real reason why I chose to write the implementation in C, besides the fact that I couldn't quickly think of a way to use an address-of operator in Java.
However, I also wanted to use Processing's draw functions since Ive had prior experience with them; the C code is thus includes jni.h.

I am fully aware that this implementation is a roundabout and inefficient way to produce the results I want. My goals are (in the following order) to:
1. Practice writing in C
2. Learn a little about neural networks
3. Learn how Java code can communicate with lower level code
4. Implement techniques learned in CMU's 18-213 course

Thanks!
